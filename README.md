## Project Summary

This repository contains the notebook, SQL queries, and requirements I used to analyse the **Integrated Brazilian Flight Dataset (BFD)**â€”14.7 million flight legs from 2000-2019, extended to 2023 with the latest ANAC on-time-performance releases.

## 1 Â· Why this project matters  

Commercial aviation is a cornerstone of Brazilâ€™s transport network: the country moved **95.9 million passengers in 2014 and led Latin America in Revenue-Passenger-Kilometres** (Teixeira et al., 2021; ICAO, 2015).  
By interrogating the full BFD in pure SQL, this project demonstrates:

* **Analytical depth** â€“ answering business-relevant questions on traffic growth, network structure, scheduling patterns, and operational reliability.  
* **Engineering pragmatism** â€“ scanning a parquet file locally with DuckDBâ€™s vectorised engineâ€”no separate database server required.  
* **Communicative clarity** â€“ converting result sets directly to Pandas for concise, publication-quality visualisations.

## 2 Â· Questions answered  

1. **Traffic growth** â€“ How has air traffic evolved since 2000?  
2. **Network structure** â€“ Which airports and city-pairs dominate the network?  
3. **Operational patterns** â€“ What time-of-day and seasonal schedules do airlines follow?  
4. **Service quality** â€“ Where do delays cluster, and which airlines perform best (and worst)?
